            If you're here because you want some advice regarding your cuisine you came exactly in the <em>wrong place</em>. <br>
            As you can see there are only <strong>three recipes</strong> in this site. I mean, they're cool recipes you know, but if you're looking for something
            else other than these ones, you're in a dead end. As you can see, <strong>this chef</strong> I found on Google Images is deeply <strong>judging you</strong>. <br>
            Please <strong>click on one of these links</strong> before the chef starts losing his temper. He's not happy you know, and when he loses it <strong>
                he goes absolutely ape shit fucking crazy
            </strong> and he tears you apart before you know it. He's standing still and quietly observing you so <strong><em>PLEASE</em></strong>
            ignore him and click on a recipe. <strong><em>QUICKLY.</em></strong> 
        </p>
