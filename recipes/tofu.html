        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The Tofu is a plant-based food made from <em>soybeans</em>. It's created by coagulating <em>soy milk</em> and pressing
            the curds into soft, <em>white blocks</em>. As you would correctly guess, this food tastes like <strong>literally nothing</strong>. <br>
            <strong>BUT.</strong> <br>
            This recipe is a great way to make the tofu not only <strong>edible</strong> but - hear me out - also <strong>tasty</strong>!!! <br>
            Here's how it's done.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tofu</strong> - 200 g</li>
            <li><strong>Zucchini</strong> - 1 medium sized, sliced on cubes</li>
            <li><strong>Bottarga</strong> - 20-30 g grated</li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil</strong> - 2-3 tablespoons</li>
            <li><strong>Lemon zest</strong> - 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh parsley</strong> - a handful, chopped</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong> - to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Press the <strong>tofu</strong> to remove excess moisture. You can do this by wrapping the tofu in a clean kitchen 
                towel and placing a weight on it for about <em>15-20 minutes</em>.</li>
            <li>Once the <strong>tofu</strong> is pressed, cut it into small cubes.</li>
            <li>Heat <em>1-2 tablespoons</em> of <strong>olive oil</strong> in a large skillet over <em>medium heat</em>.</li>
            <li>Add the <strong>sliced zucchini</strong> and cook until they start to soften and turn slightly golden, about <em>5-7 minutes</em>.</li>
            <li>Season with a pinch of <strong>salt</strong>.</li>
            <li>Add another <em>tablespoon</em> of <strong>olive oil</strong>.</li>
            <li>Add the <strong>cubed tofu</strong> to the skillet and cook until it's lightly golden on all sides, about <em>5-8 minutes</em>.</li>
            <li>Season with <strong>salt</strong>.</li>
            <li>Add the <strong>lemon zest</strong> and half of the <strong>chopped parsley</strong>. Toss everything together gently.</li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from the heat and sprinkle the <strong>grated bottarga</strong> over the <strong>tofu</strong> and 
                <strong>zucchini mixture</strong>. Gently toss to combine, ensuring the bottarga coats the tofu and zucchini evenly.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to a serving dish.</li>
            <li>Garnish with the remaining <strong>parsley</strong> and an extra drizzle of <strong>olive oil</strong> if desired.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Bon appetit!</em></strong></li>
        </ol>
